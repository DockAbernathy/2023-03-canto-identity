It won't be visible until the report is published. I don't have a date for that in this moment though.

@Roman How will end users interact with the subprotocols please?


[03/18/2023 14:17] Lambda#9382
There will be a frontend for each subprotocol that can be used to mint


[03/18/2023 15:17] orbitalautodev
Another possible newbie question: erc721a appears to be a missing dependency, causing a compile error in the namespace protocol. Is there a "standard library" that I'm missing?

The other 2 protocols compile with no fuss.


[03/18/2023 15:25] orbitalautodev
OK I answered my own question. You need to run "npm install erc721a". That brings in the file needed.  Also, just running the quickstart command at the bottom of the page does the trick.


[03/18/2023 17:51] dysan.
@Roman can I send you a dm?

Hi @Roman , may I please ask for just a 2 liner on fusing in the Namespace contract, eg why would a user fuse, why is it limited to 13 chars, what costs more? is it less chars or more chars, please?


[03/18/2023 23:42] ubl4nk#1934
Hi @Roman , Could  you give a brief explanation about the `AssociationType` and its concept & usage ?


[03/19/2023 02:50] mlome
@Roman Can you please explain the purpose of `Turnstile`?


[03/19/2023 03:07] orbitalautodev
Seconded.


[03/19/2023 03:09] orbitalautodev
Whatever it is, it's chainid 7700 only.


[03/19/2023 03:10] dontonka
which is canto chain.


[03/19/2023 03:12] dontonka
it does sort of registration, but identity subprotocol do the same (in fact all the subprotocols) and have been audited already, so i would not worry too much about it in the contracts in scope.

Based on the verbiage in this video around 45min, it’s a way for the authors of the contract to collect some gas fees. Seems like Canto promotes this to incentivize builders. 

https://youtu.be/pHP1hA7WGA8

This actually prompted me to find this documentation with a description and a link to the source code.

[03/19/2023 11:20] Lambda#9382
Fusing is the only way to construct new names. For instance, if you want to own :canto: 𝓹arse𝖑y, you need trays that contain each of these characters (you can either mint these trays or buy them from someone). It costs more to fuse shorter name because they are more exclusive. 13 is just an upper limit to not have too long names


[03/19/2023 11:24] Lambda#9382
`AssociationType` defines in which way a subprotocol NFT is associated with the identity NFT. I gave an example for the different types in the last contest, this might for understanding it better:
> By choosing the association type, you can control how your subprotocol can/will be used. For instance, let's imagine there is a subprotocol that represents friends (so each NFT of the subprotocol would be a friend). You could in theory register that with the three different types, which would change the meaning of the association:
> - PRIMARY: You can have exactly one (or zero) friends. Probably not very sensible, but in that case it could represent "My best friend" for instance
> - ORDERED: You can have many friends and they are ordered. That would be like the top 8 friends on MySpace back in the day
> - ACTIVE: You can have many friends and they are not ordered. This is the classical social media model that Facebook & co. uses


[03/19/2023 11:28] Lambda#9382
This is related to CSR (contract secured revenue): https://docs.canto.io/evm-development/contract-secured-revenue
With this registration, 20% of all gas fees are sent to the NFT.
Btw, there was also an audit contest for CSR: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto
If you are interested in the implementation, the code is in this repo

Where will be show josn from nft data?


[03/19/2023 20:48] orbitalautodev
Did you run the quickstart command at the bottom of the page?


[03/19/2023 22:24] Lambda#9382
Not sure if I understand the question correctly: Do you mean where the `tokenURI` output of the NFTs will be displayed? In practice in the frontend and NFT marketplaces. But it might also be shown in other places, as this function is part of the ERC721 metadata extension, so any client/frontend that supports this might consume this output


[03/20/2023 06:49] parsely.
Thank you very much.


[03/20/2023 07:52] parsely.

I've ran `git submodule update --init --recursive` but the `lib/` in the submodules won't appear in my file system


[03/20/2023 10:50] parsely.
@Franfran Not sure if its related to what you are experiencing, but quite a few things were added with NPM install command in my local directory. NPM install seems to pull from github for some other files.


[03/20/2023 10:58] Lambda#9382
I think I did not copy the git submodule information there because I only included it for reference purposes. But if you want to compile it, manually installing the dependencies via `forge install` should work. The dependencies are `ds-test`, `forge-std`, and `solmate`


[03/20/2023 13:24] Deleted User
Hello, I appended --remote-submodules --quiet to git clone
But still having problems with Namespace.  The other folders are fine.


[03/20/2023 13:25] Lambda#9382
Did you run `npm install` or the quickstart command? `npm install` is necessary for Namespace


[03/20/2023 13:26] Deleted User
I will now.  But in what folder do I run it?
